# Contributing Code by Creating a Clone #

In order to ease the contributions of other developers we have chosen to use the Mecurial version control
system for The Brave Server Project.

This means that anyone can contribute code to the project by creating a clone of the brave-server repository
and making their changes.  Normally this means, creating a clone locally.  But if you do that then how can you
push your changes so that the team can see them?  Google Code gives us a solution to this by allowing
users to create new clones of an existing repository that is hosted at their site.  Then you can clone that
repo locally and push your changes back to it.  It will then be accessible to the team and we can look at
your contribution.  See [The Contributor Guidelines](BraveServerContributorGuidelines.md) for information on how
to design, code, and format your code.

# How-To #

  1. Navigate to the "[Source->Checkout](http://code.google.com/p/brave-server/source/checkout)" tab.
  1. Select the "[create a clone](http://code.google.com/p/brave-server/source/createClone)" link.
  1. Name and describe your clone.
  1. Submit the form.

These steps will create a repository that is separate, somewhat, from the main brave-server repository
and that you will have permissions to push to.

Once you have made the changes and pushed them to the clone repo, you can submit a Code Review request through
the [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/brave-server/issues/list) tab of the brave-server site.  Make sure you
specify that the code is in a clone and give us the name of the clone.

Once that is done, we will review your change and see how we can utilize it.  After contributing a few high
quality changes, you may be invited to become a committer.

Thanks for your Support.
